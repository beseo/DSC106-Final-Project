    <h1>Utilizing Data Driven Approaches To Predict Post-Op Hospital Stay Length</h1>


    <h3>Background</h3>
    <p>
        <p>
            Your body already knows how long you'll be in the hospital after surgery. The question is â€” <b>can we decode the signals in time?</b>
            That is to ask: Can we predict hospital stay length based on preoperative measurements? <br><br>
    
            This is an important question to ask because it can benefit many stakeholders, not just the patient.
            Answering this question could allow hospitals, insurance companies, and others to better manage their businesses.
            <br>
    
            <b>Patient benefits:</b><br>
            - Being able to tell family their predicted hospital stay <br>
            - Time management, better future planning/preparation<br>
            - Monetary / insurance costs<br>
            - Financial planning <br>
            <b>Hospital benefits:</b> <br>
            - Service quality <br>
            - Resource management <br>
            - Can predict how much money they will make from a given hospital stay (because hospitals are driven by profits as well) <br>
            - Financial planning <br>
    
            <b>Insurance company benefits:</b><br>
            - Financial planning <br>
            - How much will this hospital stay cost? <br>
            - Who is at risk for certain pre-operative measurements that may cost the company more money? <br>
        </p>
    </p>

    <h3>Methods:</h3>
    <p>
        There are many measurable factors that contribute to being able to predict the length of one's hospital stay before a doctor begins operation. 
        In this study, we looked into the features (column names on the dataset in parenthesis): <br>
        - BMI <br>
        - Age <br>
        - Sex <br>
        - preoperative albumin level (preop_alb) <br>
        - ASA Physical status classification (asa) <br>
        - preoperative hemoglobin level (preop_hb) <br>
        - surgery type (optype) <br>
        - emergency operation - yes/no (emop) <br>
        - surgical department (department) <br>
    </p>
